## Biography

I hold a PhD in Marine Sciences from the University of Cádiz (2015, Summa Cum Laude) and currently develop my research career as a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the Institute of Marine Sciences of Andalusia (ICMAN-CSIC).

My research centers on the **variability and distribution of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in aquatic ecosystems**, including coastal zones, the open ocean, and transitional environments like wetlands and estuaries. I also examine global change variables—such as pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and salinity—using **long-term time series and innovative AI-based methods**.

Since 2008, I have coordinated the **Gibraltar Fixed Timeseries (GIFT)** and, since 2018, the **Balearic Ocean Acidification Time Series (BOATS)** climate monitoring programs. I have participated in 37 scientific conferences, supervised 4 Master's theses, and co-supervise a PhD student. My fieldwork includes coordinating and participating in **46 oceanographic cruises** (approximately 270 days at sea) across the Southern Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Strait of Gibraltar, Gulf of Cádiz, and Baltic and Mediterranean Seas, as well as over 180 field campaigns in diverse environments.

## Current Projects

### MOMENTUM - Postdoctoral Excellence Program
**Role**: Principal Investigator
**Period**: 2024 - 2026
**Funding**: CSIC

Development of innovative methodologies based on Artificial Intelligence for the analysis and prediction of ocean carbon system parameters. The project integrates high-frequency oceanographic observation data with Machine Learning algorithms to improve our capacity to monitor and predict changes in ocean acidification.

**Main objectives**:

- Application of Deep Learning techniques to oceanographic time series analysis
- Development of predictive models for carbon system parameters
- Integration of satellite data and autonomous sensor data
- Assessment of ocean acidification trends in the Mediterranean
